    <p>As a Team of three we have registered for SheHacks conducted by <a href="https://tinkerhub.org/" target="_blank"><er>TinkerHub</er></a> Women In Tech. We have already attended many sessions and programs oriented by TinkerHub communities and Women In Tech in which all those sesssions were really interesting and gave us more knowledge, enlightenment,courage to face difficulties and support.Therefore we believe that this event will add one more feather to the cap of victory. And for all fellows this will be a great opportunity to learn new skills or to upgrade levels and tomeet exciting personalities.Looking forward for a wonderful session...</p>

  <p>I am a second year computer science and engineering student from Toc H Institute of Science and Technology.TinkerHub Women in Tech community presents she hacks, in which we wish to participate as tech enthusiasts and want to improve our skills to polish our resume. Women In Tech aims to introduce women to the tech world, by collaborating with experts and professionals, solving problems, share skills, and help build better products. we have already participated in various events organized by Tinkerhub and Women in Tech. Hence we believe this Shehacks event will provide chances for us to meet new people and to learn new skills together through mistakes. We choose Python as the main stack because it is one of the programming languages commonly used for developing websites and software, data analysis, data visualization, and task automation. And also Python has surpassed Java as the top programming language.
